# Aniwatch incident

> These incidents occurred during the days of the old r/animepiracy discord server. Many facts are based on memory and common consesus, unless corroborated with screenshots, which are difficult to source.

## Introduction

Aniwatch (.me) was a streaming site that was very popular among r/animepiracy members after the death of KissAnime in the year 2020. Its notable features include a decent UI, no ads and automatic list sync, which led to a lot of people circlejerking it as the best site.

## The WEB-DL incident

It was already commonly known fact that Aniwatch devs hated people scraping their streams and downloading them, and implemented their own little DRM [citation required] to prevent this. However, this was reversed by Snaacky and [SeaSmoke](/users/SeaSmoke), and they ended up being banned from the site for it, despite it being only for the purpose of comparing video quality.

## The discord ragequit incident

Aniwatch was enjoying its success as one of the most popular streaming sites, rising in popularity, which comes at a price, and Aniwatch was no different. There was a rumor regarding Aniwatch banning people who bad-mouthed them on the subreddit, and naturally this led to a discussion about this on the discord server. The devs of Aniwatch were also members of the server, so one of the mods - [aryn](/users/Aryn) pinged a dev requesting a comment on the matter. Taking offense to this for no reason, all the devs ragequit the server and severed all ties with r/animepiracy.

## Death

Aniwatch was already showing signs of caving under its own popularity. People would repeatedly complain of the site lagging when an episode of Attack on Titan aired. At this point, Aniwatch had been running on donations on their patreon, but it wasn't cutting it, and they were reluctant to put ads on the site. Therefore they disabled user registrations and the site went on for a while. However, their patreon was reported and they lost all their emergency donation money, which led them to announce their closure. Some rumors hint at an exit scam, but are not confirmed.

# 9anime-AnimixPlay DDoS

## Introduction

9Anime is a popular anime streaming site that reportedly has one of the largest libraries and userbase.

AniMixPlay was a small-time streaming site that scraped links from other streaming sites, namely gogoanime and 9Anime that had just recently started at that time.

## The Incident

During October, AniMixPlay began to experience issues with massive load. Eventually, it was revealed that 9Anime was DDoSing AniMixPlay using its users' connections, reportedly due to them scraping their library via a Cloudflare Proxy. The code in question was [discovered](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/comments/j94z64/comment/g8hjq2f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by Snaacky.

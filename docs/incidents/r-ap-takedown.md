# r/AnimePiracy

The r/ap discord server was taken down by Discord on May 12th (timezone varying), it was a sudden takedown that wasn't alone, several other piracy related discord servers were also taken down, the staff of the r/ap discord server quickly made a 2nd server, though it was shortlived due to being rushed out. The final server, known today as Snackbox, was originally named 'The Index' after the site commonly associated with r/ap.

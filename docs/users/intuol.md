# Intuol

Intuol (encoder name: TCV, TVVT) is an autistic cartoon encoder/YouTuber who encodes HDTV caps, and rips from streaming services among other things. He also animates for personal projects and is a video editor. He is a member of Snackbox and a frequent visitor of r/animepiracy. Older rips of his (pre-July 2022) use AMD CBR quality. intuol now uses x264 due to the quality of the rips being “pisspoor”. He isn't really much of an anime fan but does watch Pokemon from time to time.

## TV Ripping journey

intuol started recording episodes of cartoons since 2015-2016. He used Unregistered Hypercam 3 and a Streamlive.to stream. Sometime in late 2016, intuol found arconaitv and screen recorded an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants that was in a Google Drive folder called “Nickelodeon TVRips”. He also switched recording software too. He used Bandicam. He then went back to screen recording Streamlive.to in mid 2017. During that point, he recorded “Sportz/Genie in a Bottle” episode from SpongeBob SquarePants. He stopped until a series caught his eye by the name of “Unikitty”. He recorded 13 out of the 40 episodes that season 1 aired. He uploaded 4 of them to YouTube which skyrocketed viewership to his old channel. During mid 2019, he found an IPTV exploit where people can abuse free trials. He kept the method secret until April 2020 where he posted the method on Blogspot. It got good reception until he removed it.

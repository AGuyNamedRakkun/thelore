# Omuricee

Infamous for the [Omu Incident](/incidents/omuricee).

Omuricee is a very infamous person in the anime piracy community, he was involved with the site Anikuru, and was well known on servers such as Snackbox. This would change when during a week long mute on Snackbox, Omuricee used an alt named rombaking so he could talk while timed out. He would be exposed when, while trying to fix some issues he had with Linux, a screenshot showed the name 'Omuricee' exposing his alt to everyone there.

After his alt was banned, along with his main account, it was discovered that Omuricee had his alt on Anichiraku, a server he was banned from. He would then try joining servers he was banned from on alts to try and sneak in, this caused a joke on Snackbox that every new member that joined was an Omuricee alt.

## Beginnings/Anikuru

Omuricee first became notable in the anime piracy scene due to his involvement with the private anime site Anikuru, he was one of the founding members of the site and was quite involved with it.

# SeaSmoke

SeaSmoke ~~was~~ ~~is~~ was an encoder, fansubber and former r/animepiracy mod. He is notable for being the creator of the [SeaDex](https://releases.moe), a sheet that aims to list the most high quality releases for an anime, post rigorous analysis by various experts on video quality. He is also known for making suspicious statements about wanting to "lewd lolis".

SeaSmoke was a very well known figure on the subreddit for his knowledgeable comments that'd somehow always get downvoted to oblivion despite being true.

# Absynth

Absynth, also known as Amber, was a r/animepiracy discord and reddit moderator in 2020-2021.

Originally invited by snaacky to be the first female body in the administration, It did not take long for both of them to go well along and start having a matching discord profile pictures for a while.

She quickly stopped moderation of the reddit as she thought there are to many braindead people who are unable to use the search function that is built into reddit. She hated the looks of old reddit and refused to use it despite it providing a way better experience.

Most notable achievments:

- First girl that was a moderator
- First girl to leave the role of moderator
- Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss

Legends say that redacted still cries after she left.

# Private Tracker Cabal

The *private tracker cabal* is a cabal consisting of three main private trackers, private trackers being torrent sites who require registration to enter. These cabal sites are said to hold power and influence over all cabal-affiliated private trackers.

The cabal consists of the following three trackers:

- HDB (HDBits)
- BTN (BroadcastTheNet)
- PTP (PassThePopcorn)

## Why is it called the cabal?

They are called the cabal due to their high standing in the private tracker sphere.

They also function as a [cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel), due to their nature of sharing user information among each other, as well as with cabal-affiliated sites (GGn, RED, AB), in cases where the user in question has broken any golden rules. Being banned on one cabal site for such a violation usually results in getting banned on all cabal and cabal-affiliated sites.

The golden rule violations are typically related to invite selling and trading.

## Notes

The 'cabal' is an unofficial private tracker term and should not be used in conversations on private tracker forums, IRC channels, or staff PMs.
